# Project "Rosetta of Saint-Denis" #

This project is my first front-end development project. It has several preconditions:

* I have long wanted to learn the basics of web development;
* I have ideas for some projects;
* It is desirable for the programmer to understand the basics of HTML;
* At the institute where I study, I was assigned a laboratory work in which it is necessary to write a simple website in HTML.

As for the task... So I decided _"Hmm, why don't I just make a website in HTML only, but also add style and some action to it?!"_. Then I remembered my old desires and decided to write a website using HTML + CSS + JS. Thus, I made the task more interesting and more rewarding to complete. The skills I have acquired in the course of my work may be useful in the future.

I decided to make a website for my fictitious workshop for creating and manufacturing stained glass windows, because I really love stained glass windows!
